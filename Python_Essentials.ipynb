    "Congratulations, you made it through the new content for the first section of the prework! This cumulative lab will help you review and practice everything you've learned in this section — \"putting it all together\" into an analysis with real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Recall the data types covered so far\n",
    " - Practice extracting information from a nested dataset\n",
    " - Practice generating insights with conditional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task: Analyze Amazon Review Data\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 2. Review Selection\n",
    "Create a variable `review_index` that can be changed, so that your code will select any review from the collection in order to print out information.\n",

    "#### 3. Review Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### a. Positive, Negative, or Neutral\n",
    "Print out information describing whether a review's rating is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",

There are a lot of other options in the `display` submodule that we won't cover, but you can read about them [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.display.html)."
